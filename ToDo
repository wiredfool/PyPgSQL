=====ToDo=====
  - Test with something other than the unit tests
  - See if there's some way to reduce the number of copies of the string when running 
    a bytea, since there's the original, one out of libpq, one with E' ' added, and 
    one made to return to python from C land.
  - rework the toggleShowQuery to not make an element access have side effects. 
  - Raise a warning on version < 8.x?  
   

=====Done=====
  - Quoting needs to be done with the PQescapeStringConn, PQEscapeByteaConn 
    methods to ensure proper quoting. 
  - The hex encoding switch should be done automatically from the connection. 
    - Done in the libpq/PQEscapeByteaConn function. 
  - use pqUnquoteBytea. 
  - return the quote functions in and make a big deprecation warning. 
  - Test on 8.2->9.0
