    pyPgSQL - A Python DB-API 2.0 Compliant Interface to PostgreSQL
    ======================================================================
    pyPgSQL is a package of two (2) modules that provide a Python DB-API
    2.0 compliant interface to PostgreSQL databases.  The first module,
    libpq, exports the PostgreSQL C API to Python.  This module is written
    in C and can be compiled into Python or can be dynamically loaded on
    demand.  The second module, PgSQL, provides the DB-API 2.0 compliant
    interface and support for various PostgreSQL data types, such as INT8,
    NUMERIC, MONEY, BOOL, ARRAYS, etc.  This module is written in Python. 
    This version works with PostgreSQL 7.0 or later and Python 2.0 or
    later.
